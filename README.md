# ubseds-testfire-calibration-tool
This is a tool to make calibration for testfires easier for propulsion to manage. The program takes in a csv file containing input data from the test-fire loadcell as input. It then cuts off excess data on the edges of the file and identifies the mV values associated with the weight used in testing.

**Disclaimer:** The program doesn't match mV to weight. It only outputs the values in the order in which the weight was added. Match it yourself, losers.
